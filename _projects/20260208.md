The empirical analysis tracks the longitudinal behavior of approximately 52,743 Unique Owners  and 86,668 Unique Companies over a two decades of study period from 2003 through 2025. By utilizing a high-precision reconciliation pipeline anchored to SEC Accession Numbers, the study isolates the relationship between market experience and regulatory proficiency. The first primary visualization, a cohort-based heatmap titled "Consistency of Reporting Delays Across Years," reveals a striking stability in reporting friction. The asymmetric temporal structure of the map is a logical necessity; the empty upper-right quadrant represents "future" data points where the required tenure exceeds the time remaining in the study window. Most significantly, the heatmap demonstrates cross-cohort uniformity, where "red" and "orange" zones—signifying compliance rates between 50% and 60%—persist vertically across almost all entry years. This proves that the difficulty in meeting the Sarbanes-Oxley 2-day mandate is not merely a "newcomer" issue but a systemic friction affecting the 2003 "vintage" as severely as the 2024 cohort. Furthermore, observing any single calendar year shows that "veteran" insiders with high tenure do not exhibit significantly better profiles than new entrants, indicating a near-zero correlation between market longevity and reporting proficiency.


- There are 52,743 Unique Owners- These are the specific people, like company bosses or even the board of directors, who have ""inside"" knowledge. Each owner has a unique ID number called a CIK."

- There are 86,668 Unique Companies- These are the different businesses where the trading is happening. Some companies have many bosses trading at once, which creates a very busy ""hub"" in our bipartite map.
