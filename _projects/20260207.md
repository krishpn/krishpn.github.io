"The Evolution of Reporting Efficiency: Tenure vs. Compliance," abstracts these cohorts into an aggregate learning curve to measure the impact of cumulative experience on accuracy. The data labels reveal a clear "Compliance Ceiling"; at "Year 0" (Market Entry, index 2003), the compliance rate is 58.3%, and after twenty-one years of cumulative tenure, the rate only marginally adjusts to 60.2%. This 2% difference over two decades confirms the existence of a "Performance Plateau". While the line plot shows minor oscillations—such as a peak of 60.9% at Year 11 and a trough of 56.8% at Year 13—there is no statistically significant upward trend, suggesting that compliance is influenced more by external market cycles than by the accumulation of institutional knowledge. From the perspective of welfare economics and market failure, this provides the critical evidence for the study’s primary hypothesis: human-driven reporting processes have failed to "learn" their way out of the 40% non-compliance gap for over twenty years. Ultimately, the synthesis of these findings demonstrates that "experience" is an insufficient remedy for regulatory friction.
