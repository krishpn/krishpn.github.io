# The Evolution of Reporting Efficiency: Tenure vs. Compliance


"The Evolution of Reporting Efficiency: Tenure vs. Compliance," abstracts these cohorts into an aggregate learning curve to measure the impact of cumulative experience on accuracy. The data labels reveal a clear "Compliance Ceiling"; at "Year 0" (Market Entry, index 2003), the compliance rate is 58.3%, and after twenty-one years of cumulative tenure, the rate only marginally adjusts to 60.2%. This 2% difference over two decades confirms the existence of a "Performance Plateau". While the line plot shows minor oscillations—such as a peak of 60.9% at Year 11 and a trough of 56.8% at Year 13—there is no statistically significant upward trend, suggesting that compliance is influenced more by external market cycles than by the accumulation of institutional knowledge. From the perspective of welfare economics and market failure, this provides the critical evidence for the study’s primary hypothesis: human-driven reporting processes have failed to "learn" their way out of the 40% non-compliance gap for over twenty years. Ultimately, the synthesis of these findings demonstrates that "experience" is an insufficient remedy for regulatory friction.

## Data Preparation and Engineering

In order to assess the compliance rate over the years, a specialized pipeline was developed to convert unstructured SEC EDGAR filings into a clean, longitudinal dataset. This process involved several critical steps to ensure data integrity over the 22-year study period.

1. Identity Verification via Accession Numbers

The primary challenge in processing legacy filings is "field displacement," where names and ID numbers are often misaligned in the original text. To resolve this, the system used the SEC Accession Number as a "truth anchor". Because the first ten digits of this unique ID are automatically assigned to the filer, the pipeline could verify the identity of the Reporting Owner even when the text within the document was disorganized.

2. Heuristic Extraction and Master Verification

The pipeline scanned the header of each document to identify transaction dates and stock tickers. To prevent the inclusion of "noise" or false data, every extracted Central Index Key (CIK) was cross-checked against the SEC Master Directory. If a number found in the text did not match an official entity in the master list, it was excluded from the study to maintain high precision .

3. Categorization and Storage Efficiency

The software distinguished between individual and institutional entities by searching for corporate markers such as "LLC" or "Corp" in the names. This allowed for a detailed comparison of reporting behavior between different types of market participants. Finally, the data was migrated to a partitioned Parquet format, which reduced the storage size by 70% and enabled efficient computation for the 110,000 entities in the final sample.

Limitations of Human-Driven Compliance

A significant technical hurdle is the persistent "Compliance Ceiling" observed since the introduction of the Sarbanes-Oxley 2-day mandate in 2002 . Because the reconciliation pipeline shows that reporting delays have not improved over two decades, it suggests a structural failure in manual reporting methods.
