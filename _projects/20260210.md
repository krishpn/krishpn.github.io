        Automated Knowledge Graph Extraction of 2,000 random SEC Form 4 filings reveals a sparse, decentralized <strong>Affiliation Network</strong>. With a Network Density of 0.00533, the data indicates that only a minute fraction of potential professional connections among the 57 identified nodes are realized, reflecting a fragmented landscape of institutional associations. The Degree Distribution follows a power-law trend: most entities maintain a single connection, while rare "hubs" reach a Max Hub Degree of 3. This profile suggests that while the broader market is loosely connected, specific actors serve as critical bridges for professional influence across organizations.

        The network topology distinguishes between independent clusters and interconnected institutional webs via divergent color mapping. An Average Connectivity of 0.60 highlights that most nodes operate in isolation or small pairs rather than dense cliques. By mapping these professional bonds, the analysis exposes the "social web" of the market, identifying sparse channels through which strategic information and oversight flow between separate entities.

        The extraction simultaneously identifies a highly centralized <strong>Ownership Network</strong>. The system processed 217 total nodes connected by 34 direct ownership edges, resulting in a Network Density of 0.00073. This extremely low density confirms that ownership is concentrated within isolated silos rather than a distributed web. The Degree Distribution reveals a "long-tail" effect: the vast majority of nodes have one connection, yet the network is anchored by "Super-Owners" with a Max Hub Degree of 7.

        The graph illustrates a hub-and-spoke model, where central figures project authority across a wide array of target entities. With an Average Connectivity of 0.31, most participants remain unconnected to larger clusters, highlighting the exclusivity of multi-entity control. Divergent color mapping groups "Ownership Teams," revealing how specific insiders—including family members or designated officers—serve as primary nodes for complex structures. This converts static filings into a dynamic map of power concentration.
