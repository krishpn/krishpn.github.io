            <strong>Context-Aware Agentic Pipeline</strong><br>
            The development of the <strong>Money Map</strong> is initiated by an autonomous pipeline designed to eliminate human bias and quantify the latent social frictions governing market behavior. During the primary phase, the system functions as a digital scout, deploying <strong>Llama 3.2</strong> to parse unstructured SEC text and extract critical entities via the following forensic system instruction:

                    Mission: Reconcile external identity lists with internal document facts.
                    [PHASE 1: IDENTITY RECONCILIATION & ROLE ASSIGNMENT]
                    - TRUTH SOURCE (Filename): CIK_A={raw_cik_a}, CIK_B={raw_cik_b}, Filed_Date={filed_date}
                    - TASK: Distinguish 'Issuer' CIK from 'Reporting Person' CIK.
                    [PHASE 2: NETWORK DISCOVERY & INDIRECT MAPPING]
                    - SOCIAL: Identify family (Spouse, Son, Daughter).
                    - OWNERSHIP: Link all 'Indirect' (I) transactions to the specific family member.
                    [PHASE 3: TRANSACTION AUDIT & TEMPORAL VALIDATION]
                    - CLASSIFY: P (Purchase), S (Sale), A (Award), M (Exercise)."

        <p>
            To maintain referential integrity, the pipeline implements strict standardization logic, normalizing string variations into unique primary keys within the database. Following identity solidification, the pipeline cross-references external CIK master lists against internal document facts to resolve roles. It programmatically distinguishes between corporate "Issuers" and "Reporting Persons" while mapping the social network graph—encompassing spouses, children, and attorneys-in-fact—that constitutes the hidden backbone of the network.

            <strong>Structural Analysis: Bimodal Blocks and Scale-Free Metrics</strong><br>
            As the Parquet buckets are ingested by the visualization engine, the topography partitions into four distinct bimodal districts. The central <strong>Workplace (Affiliation)</strong> layer identifies leaders anchored to corporate hubs, while the peripheral <strong>Trading Floors (Executed S & P)</strong> monitor equity transactions. Nested within these public domains is the <strong>Social Circle</strong>, a high-sensitivity zone where family trusts and personal ties serve as clandestine informational bridges.
        </p>
        <p>
            The structural robustness of this topography is quantified through Scale-Free metrics, revealing a high-inequality degree distribution where a concentrated cohort of "Super-Stars" (${\alpha = 1.28}$) anchors the system. These navy-square "Super-Hubs," establish a resilient infrastructure capable of maintaining connectivity despite the removal of peripheral nodes.

            <strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
            The resulting scale-free network, with a power-law exponent of $\alpha = 1.28$, prioritizes the influence of central hubs over peripheral actors. This proves that market failures and adoption frictions are not anomalous events but are structural consequences of the high degree of centrality found in a few key directors and entities. This architectural vulnerability implies that the adoption of autonomous pipelines in finance will be constrained by the gatekeeping functions of these hubs, necessitating regulatory solutions that target hub-level transparency rather than broad market oversight.
