# Data Description 


Based on the [Data Engineering]({{ '/projects/20260205/' | relative_url }}), below is snapshot of data that consists of 9,201,642 counts: 

- There are 52,743 Unique Owners- These are the specific people, like company bosses or even the board of directors, who have ""inside"" knowledge. Each owner has a unique ID number called a CIK."

- There are 86,668 Unique Companies- These are the different businesses where the trading is happening. Some companies have many bosses trading at once, which creates a very busy ""hub"" in our bipartite map.

- There are 6,047,340 Individual Trades- These are trades made by single humans. We study these to see if a single person’s choices change when they know something secret before everyone else does.

- There are 3,154,302 Institutional Trades, These are trades made by big professional offices [cite: 2026-02-08]. They often trade differently than single people, and comparing the two helps us find "frictions" where the market isn't working perfectly.
